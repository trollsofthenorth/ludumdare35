# Ludum Dare #35: Shapeman

This is the first Ludumdare submission for all but one of the team members. We started working on this at 0730h EST on 2016-04-16 and finished at around 2230h EST on 2016-04-17. Since we all have full time jobs, we could not continue to work on Monday. The entire game was created in 39 hours.
